## Assignment - Eventus: Plan, search and enjoy your event now!

Hey team, you are tasked with creating a React app in 7 days (till passover), of an event planning web app.

Use Skiddle API in order to use GEO location data for event searching. **Be aware that the API is not suitable for israel and israeli events **.

Sign up to Skiddle.com and retrieve the API key from their site (it should be sent to your email).

After getting the API key, read the documentation here - https://github.com/Skiddle/web-api/wiki, afterward you should think of a unique design and features for your web app. You can use Miro + Trello + Figma in order to unleash better results.

# Submission 
You should submit your project into Google Classroom.


# If your API key does not work, here is a working one: de8a52328df07386987f9103d73e806c
